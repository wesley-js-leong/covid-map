# This repository is a collection of scripts I wrote to interpret the geographical spread of COVID-19 across the continental US.

There are two main visualizations: 2D and 3D. 

The 2D version contains only information about county-level daily new cases per 100K. Use COVID US Geospatial-Time Viz V2.ipynb for this.

The 3D version is a little more advanced and polished. It is set up to plot the compare the geographical spread of COVID with the political slant of each county 
(based on vote share in the 2016 presidential election).
